# Hybrid Dynamics for Video Generation

## Core Concept
Combining deterministic physics (ODE) with stochastic processes (diffusion) for more realistic video generation.

## Model Architecture

```python
class HybridVideoModel:
    def forward(self, x_t):
        # Physics-based deterministic part
        physics_part = solve_ode(x_t)  # For rigid body dynamics, trajectories
        
        # Stochastic diffusion part
        stochastic_part = diffusion_process(x_t)  # For complex, uncertain movements
        
        return combine(physics_part, stochastic_part)
```
