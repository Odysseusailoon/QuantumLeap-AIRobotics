# robot perceptions

data:

50k times less than vision data and much less than language data

data n compute are the bottleneck

run faster, learn faster and do better

1. data efficient robotic policy model
    
    labarious 
    
    q: more effecitively leverage real robot data from different tasks?
    1. Cross-domain imitation -
    2. transfer learning
    3. learning from large multirobot data.

    cross-paint: mirage paper.
    rovi-aug: chenfengxu paper.


    streamdiffusion

    no diffusion model for robotics. training is slow too.

    improving training efficiency: 

    rovi-aug pipeline (zeronvs)

2. compute efficient robotics policy model

low-rank decomposition: we use singualar value decomposition the llm:
llm weight matrices present long tail shape
